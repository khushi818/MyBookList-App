# MyBookList-App

# tools used

web: HTML,BootStrap, Javascript

# Learned

I learned about create , read , update and delete. Also, how to use localStorage here. I also used classes and object to have book list. 

# Challenges

I faced a challenge in making search bar. As i was updating the list the search was only showing the data after it reloads so I had to solve that prob. 
It wasn't catching the value properly so had to work on that. Updating the list was also challenging at first. Overall It was a good starter project.
